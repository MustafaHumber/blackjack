# Blackjack Game

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic casino card game, Blackjack, written in Java. The game follows traditional Blackjack rules and allows players to interact via the command line interface.

## Description

Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular casino game where players compete against the dealer to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over. In this console-based version of the game, players can hit to receive additional cards or stand to keep their current hand. The dealer follows a specific set of rules for hitting and standing. The player with the hand closest to 21 without exceeding it wins the round.

## Features

- Shuffling and dealing of cards from a standard 52-card deck
- Interactive gameplay allowing players to hit or stand
- Dealer logic for automatically hitting until reaching a hand total of 17 or higher
- Hand value calculation and bust detection
- Display of game outcome and winner determination


## How to Play

1. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler. You can use the following command:
    ```
    javac *.java
    ```

2. Run the compiled Main class to start the game:
    ```
    java Main
    ```

3. Follow the prompts in the console to play the game. Enter 'h' to hit or 's' to stand when prompted.

## File Structure

The game consists of several Java source files organized as follows:

- `Card.java`: Defines the Card class representing a playing card.
- `Deck.java`: Defines the Deck class representing a deck of 52 cards.
